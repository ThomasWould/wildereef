I never liked kombucha. Whether that be store bought, or friends brews that I would try, it just wasn’t for me. It wasn’t until the summer of 2018 when I found my love for kombucha. I was working at a camp in Evergreen, CO and my girlfriend and I went to Boulder for the day. We heard about this place called Rayback Collective which is one of the raddest places I have ever been. It was this cool warehouse turned bar, but there was this cool little place inside of Rayback that caught our eye. It was called the Rowdy Mermaid and it had about eight flavors to choose from so we bought a flight…

And that’s where I fell in love.

The flavors were so complex but smooth and left me wanting more. So we went back a couple weeks later and got more of their kombucha. After my second trip I decided to look into if I could make it, because you know I’m a broke college student. Turns out after a lot of research, I could!

A few months later and materials bought, my roommate and I started brewing! Now after almost eight months I cant get enough of it. It is like a fun science experiment every time I brew (and I HATE science). Most of all I figured out what my passion is and it is brewing. I want to continue to brew after I graduate and hopefully get it into breweries and coffee shops.

Keep dreamin big!
